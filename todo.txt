** TODO ** :
    - Implement more complex UNET model (from 128 to 1024)
    - Implement MASK-RCNN model
    - Choose some metrics : AUC, Jaccard
    - Inference file on a random sample

        

** DONE ** :
    - Download the dataset
    - Function to load the images and the masks
    - Combine sample that have several masks into a single image with all masks 
    represented( exemple : benign (98)_mask.png & benign (98)_mask_1.png )
    -> How to combine ? With a "+" or a max
    - Implement UNET model
